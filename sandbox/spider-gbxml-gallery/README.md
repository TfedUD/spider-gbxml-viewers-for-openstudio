<summary>Concept</summary>

This project was started because of a bug in Spider gbXML Viewer for OpenStudio as reported in the NREL site here:

* [Update embeddable_gbxml_editor.html to match new build from @theo-arm #3673]( https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/3673 )

I started by manually adding buttons with links for test here in the 'uncompiled' version

* [Embeddable in Iframe gbXML Core Dev 0.05.03-0eiic]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-viewers-for-openstudio/spider-gbxml-viewer-for-openstudio-2-9-0/fetch-assemble-save/v-0-05-03/embeddable-in-iframe-core-dev.html )

But then realized I would also have to manually add buttons with links to the 'compiled' version. And I also wanted to test the viewers on all th files currently available.

And that is how this was born:

## [Spider gbXML Gallery]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-viewers-for-openstudio/sandbox/spider-gbxml-gallery/spider-gbxml-gallery.html )
