# [Fetch Assemble Save Read Me]( #sandbox/fetch-assemble-save/README.md )

## Concept

Fetch source files from a CDN, assemble these into a single HTML file, save the data to a file

* Buttons allow you to select various collections of assemblies
	* Assemble Master branch of Three.js + Trackball + Basic core
	* Assemble any release from 1 to 95 - not all releases actually run
	* Assemble Master branch with latest release of gbXML Viewer Basic
	* Assemble Master branch with latest release of gbXML Viewer Basic on top of latest OpenStudio core HTML file
* Assembled text appears in a textarea element
* HTML files appear in an Iframe element
* Save button to download and save as an HTML file
* May be adapted to load any combination of HTML and JavaScript files
* 7 KB / no dependencies

Usage: best to reload page between assemblies. Keep the JavaScript console open to help spot errors.

### Full screen: [Fetch Assemble Save R2 ]( https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ladybug-tools/spider-gbxml-tools@develop/fetch-assemble-save/r2/fetch-assemble-save.html )

* Runs files loaded locally - uses xmlhttprequest rather than fetch
* gbML test file is loaded as expected
